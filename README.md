# Drawdown

This Project aims to use data visualization to teach climate breakdown more effectively. Specifically it aims to address the challenges of the complexity of climate breakdown, the cultural cognition inherent to understanding climate breakdown, and also the overwhelming sense of doom many face in hoping to solve this problem. This project was informed by my previous experience as a high school teacher teaching climate breakdown.

The design process was informed by Tamara Munzner's approach. Firstly, the problem domain was characterized (which, in this case, was visualizing climate data), data abstraction processes were based on this problem identification and characterization, before visual encodings and algorithm designs were formulated.

The work also involved prototyping an MVP with students from our class, and also some target users. These informal case studies were used to inform the design process.

I hope this will be a continuing project, so please reach out to me if you are interested in collaborating or if you have any feedback: philipfvbell@gmail.com
